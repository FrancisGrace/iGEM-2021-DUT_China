        <h2>1st ITERATION – design:</h2>
        <p>In our 1st iteration design, RIAD or RIDD was fused to the N termini of hydrophobin 4 and PETase was linked
            by a flexible linker (GGGGS)<sub>3</sub>, respectively. Moreover, RIDD was fused to the C termini of MHETase
            by a
            flexible linker (GGGGS)<sub>3</sub>. MHETase and PETase were linked (as shown in structure calculations) via
            RIDD
            peptides to accelerate MHET removement and reduce competitive inhibition to PETase. Meanwhile, short
            peptides RIDD fused to enzymes can effectively avoid disturbances to enzymes active sites. As for prudential
            and rational design, the multicomplex enzyme system we designed were evaluated via Molecular Dynamic
            simulations (MD) to ensure the structure designing feasibilities. The binding stability of the components
            was measured and the whole system was revealed to maintain its components binding stably while enzymes were
            fixed in relative near positions to each other in liquid environment. Furthermore, analysis of the key
            residues in enzymatic active sites and residues distances to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding
            site showed maintenance of structure stability (more details in <a

                    target="_blank">Model</a>). In order to purify the target protein by
            affinity chromatography, we add a His-tag to the C-terminus of each protein.</p>

        <p>In the first iteration, we plan to independently verify that each target gene (part) is useful, which means
            they were properly expressed and secreted into the culture medium . Therefore, we plan to construct three
            plasmids with targeted gene and introduce them into three <i>E. coli</i> chassis cells, and analyze the
            expressibility, secretability, and activity of three separate proteins in the three different engineered
            bacteria.</p>
        <h2>1st ITERATION – build:</h2>
        <p>The three target genes were synthesized (GenScript). To obtain three different expression vectors, the
            synthesized target genes were then cloned into three pET28a vectors, which were introduced into
            <i>E.coli</i> BL21
            by heat shock, respectively. After screening, we successfully obtained three engineered bacteria that can
            recombinantly express the target protein. So we named these three kinds of engineering bacteria <i>
                BL21/pET28a-PD, E.coli BL21/pET28a-MD, E.coli BL21/pET28a-hA</i> (<i>E.coli BL21/pET28a-PD</i>

            pET28a-MHETase-RIDD, while <i>E.coli BL21/pET28a-hA</i> means bacteria containing pET28a-hydrophobin4-RIAD).

        <h2>1st ITERATION – test:</h2>
        <p>We obtained three engineered bacteria that can secrete RIDD-PETase, RIDD-MHETase, and RIAD-hydrophobin4
            through the previous design and build process respectively. SDS-PAGE was shown as following. (Taking
            RIDD-PETase as an example)</p>

        <h2>1st ITERATION – learn:</h2>
        <p>The results showed that the target protein was not detected in the the culture medium, while there are many
            target proteins in the bacterial fragmentation, which indicates that our recombinant protein is not properly
            secreted. However, our results contradicted with the previous report that PETase can be secreted through the
            pelB signal peptide [1].</p>
        <p>To find the reasons of this difference, we consulted with Dr. Feng Yanbin, an associate professor in DUT. He
            is one of the specialists studying <i>E. coli</i> recombinant protein. Through discussion with Dr. Feng, we
            learned
            that the pelB signal peptide has strict requirements for the hydrophobicity of the first 20 amino acids at
            its N-terminal. According to the literatures, the sequence following pelB is PETase [1],while in our
            design it is the amino acid sequence of RIDD linked to pelB. Due to the significant difference between the
            strong hydrophobicity of RIDD and the general hydrophobicity of the first 20 amino acids of PETase, PETase
            might not be secreted in our study. Similarly, the hydrophobicity of RIAD and RIDD exceeds that of ordinary
            proteins, pelB becomes ineffective and cannot function well. We took the suggestions from Dr. Feng and made
            two proposals for follow-up work. One is to change the signal peptide. The other is to remove the signal
            peptide once and for all, break the bacteria after expressing the recombinant protein and purify the
            recombinant protein for further study.</p>
        <p>The main goal of our design is based on the construction of multi-enzyme complexes, so the current priority
            is to verify that the multi-enzyme complexes can be prepared by <i>E. coli</i> and are active. Therefore,
            the
            signal peptide from the plasmid was removed, and the bacteria were lysed to obtain the protein. The
            subsequent researches were conducted using the enzyme complex. Aside of pelB, we have also researched
            several other kinds of signal peptides, which is discussed in more details in the <a

        <p>In the 2nd iteration, we learned from the failure of the signal peptide in the first iteration. To improve
            the strategy, we plan to remove the signal peptide and construct three engineering bacteria to continue the
            experiment, but in this iteration we only explore separately whether the three proteins can be expressed and
            remain active in bacteria. The gene routes of this iteration are shown in Figure 3.</p>

            membrane into 50 g/L skimmed milk powder and leave it at room temperature for 2 hours (slowly shake); Use 20
            g/L skimmed milk powder to dilute the anti-His mouse antibody at a ratio of 1:2000, and add an appropriate

        <h3>Enzyme activity</h3>
        <p>As is seen in the SDS-PAGE results, after cytoclasis, RIAD-hydrophobin4, RIDD-PETase, RIDD-MHETase all
            primarily existed in the precipitate, while almost none were found in the lysis medium. It was known that
            most proteins in the precipitate are in the form of inclusion bodies and not active. It is difficult to tell
            whether the target proteins were present in the medium after the cell disruption by direct observation.
            Therefore, we performed western-blot analysis. The results showed that there was still a small amount of
            RIDD-PETase in the medium, indicating that instead of waiting for the results of renaturation experiment,
            the medium can be used to determine the enzyme activity of RIDD-PETase, RIDD-MHETase as crude enzyme
            solution.</p>
        <p>Since it takes a long time to degrade PET plastics, it is impossible to effectively and scientifically
            measure the enzyme activity of MHETase alone, so we referred to the method of iGEM 2016
            <a href="http://2016.igem.org/Team:Harvard_BioDesign" target="_blank">Harvard_BioDesign</a> team and
            designed a set of methods suitable for our <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:DUT_China/Experiments"

            was measured using pNPB, a universal substrate for esterases. Under the reaction of pNPB esterase,
            p-nitrophenol can be generated, which has a strong absorption peak at 405 nm. In a set period of time, the
            higher the absorbance of the mixture of pNPB and enzyme solution is at 405 nm, the higher the yield of
            p-nitrophenol and the greater the enzyme activity.</p>

        <p>Based on the results (Figure 5), we found that both RIDD-PETase and RIDD-MHETase have esterase activity.
            After
            20 minutes of reaction, each resulted in absorption peaks as high as 3.4873 and 2.7654 at 405 nm.</p>

        <h2>2nd ITERATION – learn:</h2>
        <p>The results showed that the three engineered bacteria we constructed could produce various target proteins
            (Figure 5). The presence of protein can be detected in the medium by Western blot. After we added the
            scaffold of RIDD to PETase and MHETase, the enzymes still exhibited esterase activity and the substrate pNPB
            was degraded. This indicates that the addition of the short peptide RIDD is likely to have no effect on the
            PET degradation activity of the enzyme. Because hydrophobin 4 itself does not have enzymatic activity, as
            any ordinary hydrophobin, after adding hydrophobic RIAD, the hydrophobicity will not change
            dramatically.</p>

        <h2>3rd ITERATION – design</h2>
        <p>We are trying to construct a three-enzyme complex, so the secretion of the three target proteins is expected
            to be close to or equal to 1:1:1. This can minimize mismatches (PD-PD-hA, MD-MD-hA), and it is also
            beneficial to make full use of the produced protein to form a complex and avoid waste. To ensure that the
            target proteins are produced at a ratio close to or equal to 1:1:1, we decided to use the same exact
            promoter, lactose operon, RBS, and terminator to regulate the three target genes after discussion with Prof.
            Zhu Zhiwei in DUT. Also, we decided to integrate PD, MD and hA into one plasmid (Figure 8).</p>

        <h2>3rd ITERATION – test</h2>
        <h3>SDS-PAGE</h3>
        <p>According to the first two rounds of engineering and the third round of design and construction, we have
            obtained engineered bacteria that can theoretically secrete all three target proteins simultaneously. After
            IPTG induction of these engineered bacteria, we obtained a large amount of <i>E.coli
                BL21/pET28a-PD-MD-hA</i>,
            and
            the enzyme was extracted. However, due to the small molecular weight of RIAD-hydrophobin4, it can not be
            found on SDS-PAGE. (As for the three protein moulecular weight, RIDD-PETase is 32 kDa, RIDD-MHETase is
            68 kDa, RIAD-hydrophobin is 11 kDa.</p>

        <h3>Enzyme activity</h3>
        <p>The results of SDS-PAGE showed that there is still a large amount of target protein in the precipitates (only
            RIDD-PETase and RIDD-MHETase). Based on the previous Western blot results, it was reasonable to speculate
            that the target protein might be present in the cytolysis medium, so we again employed the pNPB method. The
            enzyme activity was tested with the medium of <i>E. coli BL21/pET28a-PD-MD-hA</i> as crude enzyme
            solution. To
            control variables, the volume of crude enzyme solution in this experiment was the same as that used in the
            previous determination of the RIDD-PETase crude enzyme solution and RIDD-MHETase crude enzyme solution. The
            enzyme activity determination curve was shown in Figure 9.</p>
        <p>It is not difficult to conclude that the slope of PD-MD-hA is higher than that of PD or MD, which indicates
            that as a crude enzyme solution, the medium of <i>E.coli BL21/pET28a-PD-MD-hA</i> has esterase
            activity. What's
            more, the final concentration of p-nitrophenol was higher than that of the two esterases alone, which
            suggested that the three-enzyme complex was successfully constructed.</p>

        <h3>PET plastic sheet degradation test</h3>
        <p>We obtained PET plastic sheet with 12% crystallinity (scientific research only) from <a
                href="http://2021.igem.org/Team:TJUSLS_China" target="_blank">TJUSLS_China</a>, and cut
            it into 5 mm*5 mm fragments (0.07 g per fragment). We incubated 1.5 mL of <i>E.coli</i> BL21, <i>E.coli
                BL21/pET28a-PD</i>,
            <i>E.coli BL21/pET28a-M</i>, <i>E.coli BL21/pET28a-PD-MD-hA</i> cell pellet and medium in several EP
            tubes, and added three
            5 mm*5 mm fragments, respectively. We then incubated the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 7 days. After 7 days,
            the
            degradation product, erephthalic acid (TPA), was detected by UV Spectrophotometry and thus determined PET
            degradation efficiency.</p>
        <p>In terms of measurement, we chose to use UV spectrophotometry to detect the output of TPA. Binding with
            RIDD-PETase and RIDD-MHETase, PET will be decomposed with ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA)
            as final product. Ethylene glycol is volatile, and the test results are not credible, so we decided to
            detect TPA. Through previous literature research, we found that there are two mainstream detection methods
            for TPA. One is to directly perform UV spectrophotometry on the sample. The increase in absorbance of the
            reaction mixture in the ultraviolet region of the light spectrum (at 240 nm) indicates the release of
            soluble TPA or its esters from an insoluble PET substrate. This compound shares an identical strong
            absorbance peak around 240–244 nm with an identical extinction coefficient as all three compounds contain
            the same number of carbonyl groups. The second is to adopt reverse-phase HPLC. Reverse-phase HPLC systems
            have been widely used to analyze the products derived from the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET owing to their
            powerful resolving capability and reproducibility. The different compounds produced by PET hydrolytic
            enzymes (i.e., TPA, MHET, and BHET) can be efficiently separated on a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column: The
            reaction mixture is loaded into a column equilibrated with a polar mobile phase and the concentration of the
            organic solvent (acetonitrile).</p>
        <p>Considering our experimental cycle, throughput, and laboratory conditions, we chose UV spectrophotometry to
            detect TPA. Then we made the standard curve of TPA at OD240 (Figure 13).</p>
        <p>The liquid obtained after incubation of the above eight samples was tested for TPA content, and the blank
            absorption was subtracted. The data obtained is shown in Figure 10.</p>
        <p>It can be seen from the concentration of TPA product that the concentration of TPA in PD-MD-hA's medium is
            higher than that in PD's medium or MD's medium. This strongly supported the engineering success of our
            three-enzyme complex construction.</p>

        <h3>Scanning electron microscopy</h3>
        <p>To further confirm the activity of the three-enzyme complex we constructed, we also selected PET plastic
            sheets in <i>E.coli</i> BL21, <i>E.coli BL21/pET28a-PD</i>, <i>E.coli BL21/pET28a-M</i>, <i>E.coli
                BL21/pET28a-PD-MD-hA</i>
            medium to be
            examined by scanning electron microscopy The results were consistent with expectations. The plastic sheet
            treated with either <i>E.coli</i> BL21 medium or MD medium has almost no scratches or holes. The plastic
            sheet
            after PD treatment has some obvious scratches, while the plastic sheet after PD-MD-hA treatment showed
            surface covered with scratches, and at the same time, densely packed with holes of various shapes. This
            scanning electron microscopy further proved that the three-enzyme complex we constructed has a better PET
            plastic degradation activity than single-enzyme degradation.</p>

        <h2>3rd ITERATION – learn</h2>
        <p>The third engineering cycle is the last cycle of our main line of experimental tasks. Briefly, we
            successfully constructed three-enzyme complex as expected, measured the complex's enzyme activity, and
            performed scanning electron microscopy and TPA detection experiments. The degradation effect of the
            three-enzyme complex on PET plastic was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>
        <p>Through the qualitative test of scanning electron microscopy, the enzyme complex created in our project has
            better effect on PET plastic sheets than PETase alone. The use of PETase alone will only cause scratches on
            the surface of the plastic sheet. However, our enzyme complex has exceeded PETase activity, causing more
            significant scratches and on top of that, producing many deep holes. The results of scanning electron
            microscopy also indirectly accounted for the role of hydrophobin 4 in the enzyme complex. With the presence
            of hydrophobin 4, the enzyme complex can bind to the surface of the PET plastic sheet. Therefore, instead of
            dispersing in water and induce reaction through random collisions, the enzyme is more likely to dig deeper
            into the surface.</p>
        <p>Through the quantitative test of TPA production detection, we found that the degradation effect of our enzyme
            complex is better than PETase used alone, and the degradation efficiency has been increased by two
            times.</p>
        <p>Overall, we successfully constructed a three-enzyme complex, and confirmed its activity by analysis of
            degradation effect and product yield . It will be promising for the subsequent enzyme complex to efficiently
            degrade PET plastic and the industrialization of PET plastic bio recycling.</p>
