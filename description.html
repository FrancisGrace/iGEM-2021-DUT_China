        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Wide spreading and utilization of plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in the world has caused a large
            quantity of environmental challenges and gained much attention. Because of its nonbiodegradability, a large
            amount of plastic waste accumulation forms a global environmental crisis [1]. Notably, in 2016, Yoshida et
            al. reported the discovery of the bacterium, <i>Ideonella sakaiensis</i> [2]. Microbe <i>Ideonella
                sakaiensis</i> was reported to be capable of secreting two efficient enzymes to deconstruct PET polymers
            in mild temperature. First, <i>Ideonella sakaiensis</i> PETase, a structurally well-characterized consensus
            α/β-hydrolase fold enzyme, converts PET to mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET). MHETase, the second
            key enzyme, hydrolyzes MHET to the PET educts terephthalate and ethylene glycol [3].</p>
        <p>However, this two-enzyme system degradation capacity is highly limited by inhibition effects, diffusion of
            intermediates and PET surface physicochemical properties [4]. Here, we design a delicate multicomplex enzyme
            system, in which short peptide tags (RIAD and RIDD) are applied to create scaffold-free modular enzymes
            assemblies [5]. In order to effectively degrade microplastic PET particles, we construct enzymes of <i>Is</i>PETase
            and MHETase and protein hydrophobin in our complex system via scaffold modular part, which reveal higher
            catalytic efficiency in mild temperature. All proteins involved have unique functions in our system.
            <i>Is</i>PETase and MHETase are two enzymes involved deconstructing polymer PET plastic to MHET and MHET to TPA
            molecules, respectively. And hydrophobin protein, a small fungal protein, possess positive effects on
            altering the physicochemical properties of PET surfaces and enzyme aggregation enhancement when it was fused
            with PET degradation enzyme cutinase [6]. In conclusion, our work presents an innovative strategy to improve
            PET degradation via biosynthetic factories and artificially designed proteins system that do not exist in
            the nature.</p>
