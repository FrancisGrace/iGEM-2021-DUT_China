    <p>In order to develop a proof of concept for our project as a whole, we come up with the following ideas. These
        experiments and prototypes may increase the credibility of our concept, making it more in line with realistic
        scenarios.</p>

        <h1>1. The three-enzyme complex can effectively degrade PET plastic sheets, with improved degradation efficiency
            compared with single enzyme reaction.</h1>
        <p>The enzyme complex we constructed can effectively degrade PET plastic, and the efficiency is higher than that
            of single enzyme (RIDD-PETase) treatment, which introduced in our engineering success. The increase in
            degradation efficiency can prove the feasibility of our concept. After 7 days of incubation with the crude
            enzyme solution and PET plastic sheet (crystallinity 12%), the TPA yield reached 0.9016mM, instead of using
            enzyme complex, only one part (RIDD-PETase) was used to process the TPA yield Only 0.4815mM (Figure 1).</p>

            the
            results were in line with expectations. The plastic sheet treated with <i>E. coli BL21</i> medium or MD
            medium has
            almost no scratches or holes. The plastic sheet after PD treatment has some obvious scratches, while the
            plastic sheet after PD-MD-hA treatment. The surface is covered with scratches, and at the same time, densely
            packed with holes of various shapes. This scanning electron microscopy test more intuitively proved that the
            three-enzyme complex we constructed has a better PET plastic degradation function than single-enzyme
            degradation.</p>

            feasibility
            of large-scale cultivation in industrial production.</h1>
        <p>In order to obtain a large amount of protein, it is necessary to cultivate engineered bacteria at a
            relatively high density. However, introducing <i>pET28a-PD-MD-hA</i> into engineered bacteria may slow down
            the
            growth and replication speed due to the load of plasmids, which increases the cost of the bacterial culture
            process for the industrialized mass production of enzymes. Therefore, we decided to use 1L of LB medium to
            cultivate different types of bacteria at 37 °C, and compare the growth curves of <i>E. coli
                BL21/pET28a-PD-MD-hA</i>
            and <i>E. coli BL21</i> (wild type) , <i>E. coli BL21/pET28a</i> to examine the growth of the engineered
            bacteria we

            exhibited virtually the same growth trend as <i>E. coli BL21</i> and <i>E. coli BL21/pET28a,</i> suggesting

        <p>PelB is a signal peptide using SecB-dependent pathway and has been commercially used in PET expression
            systems (Figure 4). We initially planned to use pelB as signal peptide to achieve effective secretion of the
            target protein, but the expected goal was not achieved in the experiment. The normal functioning of pelB is
            closely related to the hydrophobicity of the subsequent 20 amino acids, and the RIDD and RIAD used in our
            system do not meet its hydrophobicity requirements, which results in the failure of enzyme secretion.</p>

            biodegradation of plastic. However, in this way, we have to solve a problem: the final product of PET
            plastic degradation, TPA and EG may have a negative impact on bacterial growth, so we have studied growth
            curve of engineered bacteria under different concentrations of TPA and EG.</p>

        <p>We need to verify whether the products of PET degradation ——TPA and EG inhibit or promote bacterial growth.
            As shown in left part of Figure 6, EG with concentrations of 0%, 0.1%, 1% and 5% were added to the culture
            medium respectively. After 19 hours of observation, the four growth curves were basically consistent, which
            proved that EG had no significant effect on the growth of bacteria; On the other hand, in Figure 6 right, it
            can be seen that <i>E. coli BL21</i> grew normally in the medium with low TPA content of 0, 0.1mM and 1mM.
            However,
            when the TPA content was too high(10mM), <i>E. coli BL21</i> did not grow. Obviously, high concentration of
            TPA
            will inhibit bacterial growth, so it is necessary to remove or further degrade TPA to avoid its high
            concentration in the process of PET degradation in bacterial culture or in industrial production.</p>

        <p>The workflow of this kill-switch system involves three modes. During the propagation stage, the kill-switch
            system is silenced, where only the TpiAB transporter is synthesized. Because of the presence of terminator
            B0015, no toxin is produced.</p>
        <p>When TPA is detected by the sensor system provided by a previous iGEM Team <a
                href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:UMaryland" target="_blank">UMaryland</a>, suggesting the
            degradation process has begun, the TphC transcriptional activator will be activated, thus initiating the
            production of both the antitoxin and DRE recombinase. The recombinase will in turn cut the terminator B0015,
            which leads to the permanent activation of the expression circuit of the toxin. However, under this
            situation, both antitoxin and toxin are present in the system, so the cell itself will continue to thrive
            and the degradation ensues.</p>
        <p>After the detection of TPA, as long as the concentration of TPA reduces to a certain level, which means that
            the degradation has finished or the cell is dispersed in the environment, the TphC activator will be turned
            off, terminating the synthesis of antitoxin. Whereas the production of toxin is not regulated by TphC
            activator and continues, the cell will be killed.</p>
