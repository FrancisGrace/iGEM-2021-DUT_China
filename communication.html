        <h1>1 Online promotion with ICII (into China, into iGEM)</h1>
        <p>In order to make more students learn the related content of iGEM, and stimulate students' interest in
            synthetic biology, we actively participate in the activities of ICII. Due to the need of epidemic prevention
            in schools, we held an online seminar using the Tencent Meeting. First, the team members carefully
            collated the relevant information, including the iGEM profile, the main work and significance of DUT_China,
            the work of other teams, etc. to make a push and PPT. Then, we through the Moments, QQ group, WeChat
            public accounts in the relevant push, interested students reached out to us, we counted the relevant number
            of people. Next, we held an online presentation at the prescribed time. The captain and some students gave
            us a vivid explanation of what we had prepared. And, at the end of the online promotion, we randomly
            selected a few students, asked their feelings, timely feedback received from the students. Finally, we put
            together a group photo, video and other information to the relevant students for the production of
            promotional video.</p>

        <h1>2. Summer synthetic biology education activities</h1>
        <p>This summer, some members of our iGEM team went to Zongbao villagers and Hajia Village, Haidong City, Qinghai
            Province, for synthetic biology education. After half a month of teaching, local children learned much
            knowledge, and we also learned a lot.</p>
        <p>When explaining synthetic biology to children, we mainly explained the contribution of synthetic biology to
            life and production and what synthetic biology can do. Starting from the reality of their lives and from
            their perspective, it is easier for them to understand what synthetic biology is and what synthetic biology
            can achieve. As the first synthetic biology enlightenment education for these children in their lives, we
            believe that we have made them aware of synthetic biology and have a strong interest in synthetic biology.
            In the future, we may choose to Enter the field of synthetic biology and make outstanding contributions to
            mankind.</p>
        <p>The teaching team added synthetic biology courses to the curriculum because the children in the countryside
            rarely came into contact with such courses in previous classrooms. After seeing an amazing imagination,
            creativity, and ability to accept new knowledge in the children, the team members clearly realized the
            importance of quality education and all-around development in education. They also realized that rural
            education also We must always accept and practice good educational concepts. The teaching team found in the
            group home visits that many children are also "left-behind children," and they have some problems in
            self-confidence and future planning.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the team members are not very good teachers, and they can't control their tempers, and they will
            yell at the children who are not obedient or disciplined in class. After really starting to have a group of
            students of their own, the team members really realized the difficulty of being a teacher. In their works,
            the players can experience the innocence and happiness that belong to the children, as if they have walked
            into a fairy tale paradise. Their childish words make the players laugh and think. In the constant contact
            with children, we can feel their hope for more knowledge, and we are also infected by their simple thoughts
            and innocent smiles. The team members have gradually become more and more familiar with each other, and
            their daily life matters have also become better and better. From the very beginning, the daily dinner and
            lunch are often late and taste bad, and then they are ready on time and delicious. The daily fetching of
            water, cooking, washing dishes, and hand-washing clothes made the team members experience the breath of life
            so close for the first time, and the team members also learned a lot in this simple rural life.</p>
        <p>Classes are taught during the day, cooking, cleaning, and home visits. At night, class preparation and
            housekeeping are organized, and daily meetings are carried out in an orderly manner. On the first day in
            Qinghai, we may feel that time flies very slowly. We have 14 days of teaching life, and we always feel that
            we still have a long time to get along with the children. But the graduation ceremony came really suddenly,
            and we were about to say goodbye to the children, but we were not ready yet; the team members knew that the
            team members would miss every lesson they had, and they would miss everyone that could hear them. In the
            morning of the morning reading, we will miss those smiling faces that are still smiling after being
            mischievous. They are so cute and so likable. On the last day of class, some children complained, "Why is
            the last day so harsh?" What they don't know, it's not that the team members want to treat them harshly;
            they want to teach them as much knowledge as possible. , Reluctant to leave them. We think in this era,
            vision and knowledge can be obtained on the Internet, and in this short half-month, the team members may be
            able to give a few goals, let them have the desire to go out, let them realize their wishes confidently,
            they are children with dreams, and their world should be very broad. That's it. The players here bring them
            a green window, leaving them with a short memory. It may be a year or two that these bits and pieces will
            become lighter and lighter, but the players will always have A window opened for them. The team members are
            very happy and unforgettable this summer.</p>

            opened for them. The team members are pleased and unforgettable this summer.</p>
        <p>The summer teaching support of the teaching support team ended successfully. The teaching support team not
            only contributed their love and strength during this teaching trip but also practiced the concept of
            "serving rural education and practicing green support teaching." At the same time, the teaching support team
            members have also gained the belief that we must be down-to-earth, diligent, and conscientious, go all-out
            for a better future and realize self-worth. The summer school support is concise, but the impact on all the
            members and children of the support team is far-reaching. This spirit of courage to assume social
            responsibility will also be passed on from generation to generation.</p>
        <p>During the trip to support education, the support team members and the children are all achieving a better
            future together. This trip to support education conveys the knowledge is not only synthetic biology but also
            the faith to be down-to-earth, diligent, and conscientious, to go all out for a better future, and realize
            one's own value.</p>

        <h1>3. The Hundred-club jamboree of DUT</h1>
        <p>The Hundred-club jamboree appearance show organized by the Youth League Committee Management Department of
            the school and presented to the school's freshmen. As an excellent society, the iGEM society participated in
            promoting and introducing the Hundred Regiment Battle of Dalian University of Technology. While introducing
            the concept, development, and application scenarios of synthetic biology to the teachers and students of the
            school, let more people experience the charm of synthetic biology firsthand, let them walk into the
            promotion booth of our iGEM community, and be guided by our professionals Under the acceptance, much
            knowledge of synthetic biology has been popularized.</p>
        <p>Combining with traditional Chinese calligraphy art has added a cultural atmosphere unique to synthetic
            biology in China. At the same time, we have also attracted many students interested in synthetic biology to
            join our iGEM community as an infusion of freshness. Blood, we believe they will also popularize and promote
            synthetic biology for more people in the future and contribute to the development of synthetic biology.</p>
