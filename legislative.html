            We are a student team from Dalian University of technology.
            During the process of studying plastic degradation, we found
            that the domestic plastic pollution has not been well solved
            yet while it has formed a mature governance system at abroad.
            Through research and interviews among specialists, we believe
            that the problem of plastics has become a global problem and is
            becoming more and more serious due to it is small and difficult to
            degrade. Thus, we suggest that the relevant laws of controlling plastic
            pollution should be improved as soon as possible in order to pave
            the way for the development and industrialization of plastics garbage
            disposal in China.

        <h1>1 The urgent need to develop and improve the related laws and regulations</h1>
        <h2>1.1 The status of plastics pollution</h2>
        <p>Plastics are widely used in production and life
            and are important basic materials. Nonstandard production
            and use of plastic products and recycling and disposal of
            plastic waste will cause waste of energy and resources
            and environmental pollution, and increase the pressure
            on resources and environment. Currently, large amounts
            of plastic debris are entering landfills or are left
            as waste accumulated in natural world, and itâ€™s a public
            emergency to prevent its release and accumulation in the
            environment via appropriate biological, chemical, and physical treatments.

        </p>
        <p>In August 2021, the United Nations Biodiversity Organization released the document "The global plastic crisis is
            imminent". More than 180 countries and regions passed the plastic waste amendment of the Basel Convention,
            calling on human beings to minimize the generation of plastic waste and carry out environmentally sound
            management.</p>
        <h2>1.2 The domestic control of plastic pollution in China</h2>
        <p>In China, as one of the world's top 10 producers and consumers of plastic products, Chinese natural environment
            and city are faced with severe plastic pollution and high recycling pressure. In 2020, China produced 70.302
            million tons of plastics and imported nearly 450 thousand tons. The total consumption of plastics in China in
            2019 was about 90.877 million tons, of which millions of tons were used for packaging. Most of the plastic used
            for packaging is discarded in the environment in the form of waste film, plastic bags and cutlery. In terms of
            consumption level, the consumption of bottle-grade PET in China continues to grow from 6.33 million tons in 2016
            to 9.49 million tons in 2020. In 2020, the total consumption of PET bottles in China reached 9.49 million tons.
            Although the export volume decreased to 2.34 million tons due to the epidemic in 2020, accounting for 24.7% of
            the total consumption, the domestic demand continued to expand, reaching 7.15 million tons. All these demands
            and consumptions have caused severe challenges in environment, especially for over accumulation of frequently
            used plastic form, PET, in biosphere.

        <h1>2 The urgent need for NPC Standing Committee to issue relevant laws and regulations on plastic pollution</h1>
        <h2>2.1 The introduction of plastic pollution related laws is in line with the short-term goal of the NPC Standing
            Committee.</h2>
        <p>According to the opinions of the Ministry of ecological environment of the national development and Reform
            Commission on Further Strengthening the treatment of plastic pollution, more attention will be paid to the field
            of ecological and environmental protection this year. In particular, we should attach great importance to
            strengthening legislation and revising ecological and environmental protection laws. For example, it is
            prohibited to produce and sell ultra-thin plastic shopping bags and ultra-thin polyethylene agricultural film.
            It is prohibited to manufacture plastic products with medical waste as raw materials. The import of waste
            plastics is completely prohibited.</p>
        <h2>2.2 The introduction of relevant laws on plastic pollution is conducive to the standardization of the
            application
            of evidence rules in the arbitration and litigation stages of plastic pollution related cases.</h2>
        <p>We think, the laws promulgated by the NPC Standing Committee can be applied to the whole country and can be used
            as the basis for the court to decide directly. We suggests that a special law for plastic pollution should be
            established in China to avoid the loss of credibility of arbitration award or court award due to the
            inconsistency of arbitration and litigation award standards. Also, if laws and regulations are promulgated by
            other relevant departments, the order of application in law is lower than that promulgated by the NPC Standing
            Committee.</p>
        <h2>2.3 The law on plastic pollution issued by the NPC Standing Committee can be more authoritative.</h2>
        <p>The NPC Standing Committee, as a permanent organ of the highest legislature in China, enjoys the highest
            legislative power, so the revised bill on plastic pollution made by NPC Standing Committee can be applied
            nationwide, which will supply a gap of the law related to plastics.</p>

        <h1>3 Conception of the draft related to plastic pollution</h1>
        <h2>3.1 Sorting out the existing laws</h2>
        <p>At present, there is a gap in laws related to plastic pollution in China. We have collected the domestic and
            foreign laws and obtained some inspiration from the determination of aerobic biodegradability of single-layer
            and multi-layer coatings issued by the D20 plastics Committee. We have consulted experts at home and abroad who
            study in plastic pollution, and their suggestions will serve as a supplement. Good Manufacturing Practice.</p>
