        Our contribution to iGEM will mainly show two aspects on this webpage. On the one hand, it is a supplement to
        the existing parts content. The supplementary parts content is as follows; on the other hand, the peptides that
        can be used to construct enzyme complexes, RIDD and RIAD introduce the iGEM community to provide a new idea for
        other teams to construct enzyme complexes in the future and combines our literature research and practical
        experience to give some suggestions.
    </p>

                The registry part page has been supplemented with a directed evolution of an enzyme that efficiently
                degrades PET plastic, and we used this enzyme to construct an enzyme complex.

        Studies have shown discoveries in the interaction of RIAD-RIDD dimer or trimer (two RIDD with one RIAD)
        peptides. These two types of peptides have a strong binding affinity to each other. Inspired by this discovery,
        we proposed the idea that <i>Is</i>PETase and MHETase can be fused with RIDD and RIAD, respectively so that
        closer
        physical contact with the active sites of these two enzymes can significantly accelerate PET degradation through
        intermediate transmission. We further accelerate the rate of enzyme degradation without interfering with the
        structure of the enzyme active site or enzyme activity. The final result of the experiment confirmed our initial
        idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through experiments, we understand the in-depth mechanism of action between each of the critical components and
        calculate the response of the intermediate product to the enzyme, which can help us better interpret our system.

    <p>
        To apply our hybrid system to other enzyme systems, we have established a modular design that uses our modules
        based on an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of action. We will give several points for those who want to
        use this RIDD-RIAD dimer or trimer peptides system for enzyme complexes. There are several necessary conditions
        for using this molecular system:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. The enzyme upstream of the production chain must be a rate-limiting enzyme.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Characterize and calculate the combination result of the product and the enzyme. If the product has an
        inhibitory effect on the enzyme in the previous step, the enzyme system can play a more significant role.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Consider the influence of the sequence of enzymes on the activity, even though the impact of our backbone on
        the movement of the enzyme has been minimized.
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope our experience and tips can help them who are interested in modular enzyme assembly or complexes.
