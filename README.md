## Artificially designed delicate modular enzymes system for enhanced PET plastic degradation at mild temperature

Wide spreading and utilization of plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in the world has caused serious environmental challenges and gained much attention. In response, microbe Ideonella sakaiensis was reported to be capable of secreting two efficient enzymes to deconstruct PET polymers in mild temperature. However, this two-enzyme system degradation capacity is highly limited by inhibition effects, diffusion of intermediates and PET surface physicochemical properties. Therefore, we design a delicate multicomplex enzyme system, in which short peptide tags (RIAD and RIDD) are applied to create scaffold-free modular enzymes assemblies. In order to effectively degrade microplastic PET particles, we construct enzymes of IsPETase and MHETase and protein hydrophobin in our complex system via scaffold modular part, which reveal higher catalytic efficiency in mild temperature. This work presents an innovative strategy to improve PET degradation via biosynthetic factories and artificially designed proteins system that do not exist in the nature.
