        <h2>How did we meet</h2>
        <p>In April this year, after conducting literature research and actual social research, exchanges, and
            discussions with teachers and professional institutions, it was decided that the main body of this year's
            project would be the explanation of PET plastics. After the exchange of members, it was discovered that
            Tianjin University had also chosen the degradation of PET plastic as the research direction. Tianjin
            University's biological professional level is among the best in the country. As an influential university,
            exchanges and cooperation with it can promote the progress of our two sides' projects at the same time. So,
            in the end, our two sides have carried out long-term cooperation and exchanges.</p>
        <h2>Why we decided to do this cooperation</h2>
        <p>In the discussion group with them, we found that the interoperability between our projects is to degrade PET
            plastic.</p>
        <p>In addition, our two teams also have their advantages. Our school has excellent synthetic biology and related
            research teachers who can help them get in touch with teachers and provide them with plasmid optimization
            experiments. As a mature iGEM team, TJUSLS_China can guide us in some aspects and provide us with experience
            and necessary materials.</p>
        <p>According to many online exchanges between DUT_China and TJUSLS_China, we have reached a consensus on
            establishing a partnership since April. And our partnership is not limited to the exchange of the project
            process; we also provide more support for each other and promote the success of each other's projects.</p>
        <p>TJUSLS_China and DUT_China are members of Plasticase, a community dedicated to solving the problem of plastic
            pollution. At the virtual round table "Reshaping" the Future, both parties introduced their projects. The
            other side congratulated us on our success. At the same time, We also send our blessings to DUT_China and
            hope that they can get good experimental results.</p>


        <h2>What have we done for TJUSLS_China</h2>
        <p><b>March:</b> Through online methods such as QQ and e-mail, exchanges, and cooperation with TJUSLS_China in
            the direction of degradable PET plastics, and introduced our teachers to help them.</p>

        <p><b>May:</b> We were led by the team leader to Tianjin University for offline exchanges and discussions about
            the projects of both parties. During the exchange, the cooperation points of the two projects were
            clarified, and the initial problems and improved methods of the TJUSLS_China project were raised.</p>

        <p>After the visit and exchange, we followed our friends to visit their school and the scenery around Tianjin.
            During this visit and exchange, we not only gained knowledge, but also deepened our friendship with each
            other.</p>
